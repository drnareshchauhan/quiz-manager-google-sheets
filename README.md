I built a free educational app — and you can run it in your own Google Drive.
I’m sharing a free Google Sheet–based app that helps schools, colleges, and universities manage 3000+ MCQs with ease. (paper-1 & 2 separately)
✔ Auto-organises MCQs by topic
 ✔ Generates quizzes & question papers
✔ Import your existing Google quiz (by just pasting the link)
 ✔ Works entirely inside your own Google Drive
 ✔ No installs. No subscriptions. No data sharing.
You simply:
 👉 Make a copy of the sheet
 👉 Run it in your own Drive & authorise the script
 👉 Start using it
It’s discipline-agnostic and can be used by any school, college, or university.
Why free?
Because good academic tools should be accessible to everyone.
👇 The sheet link is:(also in the comment & the GitHub version if you prefer). 
Click the link, ask for permission, and I will share it with you so you can run it on your own copy.

Let’s make assessment simpler, smarter, and open for all.
